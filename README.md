# Customer Engagement Analysis in Excel

## Project Description

In 2022, there were high expectations for the growth of the ed-tech company and increased student engagement based on the introduction of new website platform features. Some of these features included:

- An XP system that enabled students to track their progress, level up, and earn rewards by completing various learning objectives.
- In-app coins that could be exchanged for special awards.
- A leaderboard where students could compete for top positions in different divisions, earning weekly rewards and advancing up the ladder.
- Streaks to motivate students to maintain consistent learning habits.
- An expanded course library covering a broader range of topics to provide students with a richer set of skills and attract a larger audience.

These enhancements were anticipated to positively impact the student experience, create an effective strategy for customer engagement, and contribute to the company's success in the coming year. 

With this Customer Engagement Analysis in Excel project, you will analyze whether the new additions to the platform have increased student engagement.
